## 3. Tracking Your Order

Once your order ships:

1. You’ll receive a **shipping confirmation email** with the carrier name and tracking number.
2. You can track your order from **My Orders → Track Package**.
3. SMS and WhatsApp tracking updates are available if you opted in.

If tracking shows “delivered” but you haven’t received the package:

- Check with family/neighbors/security desk first.
- Contact the carrier with your tracking number.
- If still unresolved after 24 hours, contact ShopEase Support.

## 4. Delivery Attempts & Address Issues

- Carriers typically make **3 delivery attempts**.
- After 3 failed attempts, the package may be returned to our warehouse.
- To avoid delays:
  - Ensure the **address and PIN code** are correct.
  - Provide reachable **contact numbers**.
  - Avoid using office addresses for weekend deliveries.

If you realize you entered a wrong address:

- Once shipped, we cannot modify the address — you may have to wait for it to return to origin before re-shipping.

- Orders below ₹499 incur a flat shipping fee of ₹49.

## 6. Delayed Deliveries

If your order hasn’t arrived **5 days after the latest estimate**, please contact Support with your order number.  
We’ll coordinate with the carrier and provide an update or issue a replacement/refund if necessary.

A package may be considered lost if:

In such cases:

2. We’ll file an investigation with the carrier (takes up to 5 business days).
3. If confirmed lost, you may choose:
   - A replacement (if in stock), or
