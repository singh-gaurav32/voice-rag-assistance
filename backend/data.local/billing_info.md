## 4. Refunds and Reversals

Refund timelines depend on your payment method:

| Payment Mode           | Refund Time (after approval) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Credit/Debit Card      | 5–7 business days            |
| UPI / Wallet           | 2–3 business days            |
| Net Banking            | 3–5 business days            |
| COD (via bank details) | Up to 7 business days        |

Refunds are initiated automatically once your return is approved or a canceled order is confirmed.  
You’ll receive an email and SMS confirmation once the refund is processed.

If the refund doesn’t reflect within the expected time, contact your bank with the **Refund Reference Number (RRN)** shared in the confirmation email.

## 5. Payment Failures

Common causes of failed or stuck payments:

- Expired or incorrect card details.
- Insufficient balance or daily limit exceeded.
- Slow network or bank server downtime.

1. Wait for **30 minutes** — most failed transactions auto-reverse.
2. If still not reflected, contact Support with:
   - Transaction ID or UTR number
   - Payment time and amount
   - Payment method used
3. We’ll confirm with the payment gateway and resolve it within **2–4 business days**.
