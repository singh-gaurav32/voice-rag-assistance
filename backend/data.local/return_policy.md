# Returns Policy

At ShopEase, we want every purchase to meet your expectations. This Returns Policy explains eligibility, timelines, procedures, and examples so customers and support agents know exactly how returns and refunds are handled.

---

## Scope

- Applies to purchases made on `www.shopease.example` unless a seller-specific policy is shown at checkout.
- Covers consumer (retail) purchases only — commercial/wholesale returns may follow different terms.
- Digital goods, gift cards, and services are handled under separate policies (see `billing_info.md`).

---

## Key deadlines (summary)

- **30 days** from delivery for most returns (standard non-defective returns).
- **7 days** for certain categories (e.g., perishable or final-sale items — see Exceptions).
- **24 hours** to report missing or visibly damaged packages upon delivery.
- **5–7 business days** for refund processing after we receive the returned item and inspect it.

> Note: You will see refund appear in your original payment method depending on the provider’s processing times (bank/card: up to 7 business days; digital wallets: typically 1–3 business days).

---

## Eligibility (what can be returned)

Items are eligible if ALL of the following are true:

- Returned within the allowed timeframe for that product category (default 30 days).
- Item is in **original condition**, unworn/unopened (where applicable), and with original tags and packaging.
- Any accessories, manuals, and freebies included at purchase are returned along with the item.

---

## Exceptions (non-returnable or restricted items)

- Items explicitly labeled **“Final Sale”** at purchase.
- Opened or used personal care/health items, consumables, or perishable goods.
- Customized or personalized products (engraving, tailor-made).
- Items missing serial numbers, tamper seals, or proof of purchase.
- Any products returned outside the allowed window unless defective and covered by warranty.

Special case: Electronics may require original packaging and proof of purchase — otherwise a repair/replacement route may be suggested.

---

## Defective / Damaged Items

If your item arrives **damaged, defective, or not as described**:

1. Report within **24 hours** of delivery for visible damage; for functional defects, report as soon as you discover the issue.
2. Provide: order number, photos of packaging and the damaged item, brief description of the defect.
3. We will evaluate and respond within **48 hours** with a return authorization and next steps (pickup, prepaid label, or drop-off).

**For defective items** we generally cover return shipping and offer:

- Replacement (preferred) — same item or equivalent.
- Full refund (including original shipping) if replacement is not possible.

---

## How to start a return (customer steps)

1. Sign in → **My Orders** → find order → click **Request Return**.
2. Select item(s) and return reason (Damaged, Wrong Item, Changed Mind, etc.).
3. Choose preferred resolution if available (Refund or Exchange).
4. Print the provided return label (prepaid if eligible) or follow instructions for drop-off/pickup.
5. Ship the item within **7 calendar days** of obtaining the return authorization.

If a prepaid label is not offered, you are responsible for return shipping unless the return is due to a defect or our error.

---

## Return shipping & fees

- **Prepaid return labels**: Provided for defective items or company errors.
- **Customer-paid returns**: If returning for buyer’s remorse (changed mind), return shipping cost is the customer’s responsibility unless otherwise stated.
- **Restocking fees**: In rare cases (bulky items, heavily discounted items), a restocking fee of up to **15%** may apply — this will be shown at the time of return request.

---

## Exchanges

- If you request an exchange for a different size/model:
  - We will attempt to ship the replacement as soon as we receive and inspect the original item.
  - If the replacement is in stock, a replacement shipment may be arranged prior to receiving the return (subject to authorization and card hold).

---

## Refunds

- Refunds are issued to the **original payment method** by default.
- Refunds include the item price; original shipping refunded only in cases of defect/our error.
- After we receive and inspect the return, refunds are processed within **5–7 business days**. Posting to your bank/card may take additional days.

---

## Partial refunds

Partial refunds may be issued when:

- Item is returned in damaged or incomplete condition.
- Only part of the order is returned (e.g., bundle components).
- A promotional discount applied originally is no longer valid for the refunded quantity.

---

## Lost returns / tracking

- Keep the return tracking number until refund is confirmed.
- If a return label was provided and the tracking shows delivered but we can’t find the parcel, contact support with the tracking number — we will investigate with the carrier.
- For customer-paid returns, we recommend using tracked/shipped services for your protection.

---

## Warranty & Manufacturer Returns

- Some products have manufacturer warranties. If so, we will advise whether to:
  - Process the return through ShopEase, or
  - Direct you to the manufacturer’s warranty process (we can assist with contact info).

---

## International returns

- International customers must follow country-specific guidelines:
  - Customs forms should accurately describe returned items as “RETURN — previously exported”.
  - Customers are typically responsible for return shipping and duties unless return is due to defect/our error.
- Processing times may be longer due to customs and international transit.

---

## Support & Contact

## Example scenarios (quick answers)

- **Q:** I changed my mind after delivery. Can I return?  
  **A:** Yes — if within 30 days and item is unopened. You’ll be responsible for return shipping unless a prepaid label is offered.

- **Q:** My package arrived with a broken item. What now?  
  **A:** Report within 24 hours with photos. We’ll provide a prepaid return label and arrange a replacement or refund.

- **Q:** I opened a sealed personal care product. Can I return it?  
  **A:** No — opened consumables and personal care products are non-returnable for hygiene reasons.

---

## Agent workflow checklist (for support agents)

1. Verify order number and delivery date.
2. Ask for photos if damage suspected.
3. Determine eligibility (time window, condition, exceptions).
4. If eligible and defective → issue RMA and prepaid label.
5. If eligible and buyer’s remorse → provide return instructions and note customer-paid shipping.
6. Log return request ID and tracking number.
7. Upon receipt, inspect and process refund/exchange; update customer.

---

## Data retention & audit

- We retain return records for **2 years** for fraud prevention and audit.
- Returned item photos and correspondence are stored alongside the order record.
